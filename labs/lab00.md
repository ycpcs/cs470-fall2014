Since we will be programming exclusively using the DirectX 11 API, we will need a Windows installation on a machine with a DirectX 11 capable graphics card. We will also be using many of Luna's utility files.

0. Getting Started
==================

-   Install Windows 8.1 Pro. Please see me if you need an installation disc and product key.
-   Install Visual Studio 2013 Pro. Please see me if you need an installation disc and product key.
-   Install the latest [DirectX SDK (June 2010)](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812).
-   Install [Luna's common utility files](Common.zip) by extracting the **3DGameProgramming** directory from the zip file and placing it in the **Documents/Visual Studio 2013/** directory.  **Failure to follow this step carefully will cause pathing problems with the lab skeleton projects.**
